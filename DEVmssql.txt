Notes on making Xaraya use MS-SQL server:
=========================================

Assumptions:
- php 5 (well, creole requires that, so that's a no brainer)
- sql server 2000

Connection notes:
-----------------

Note: In Windows, the DBLIB from Microsoft is used. Functions that
return a column name are based on the dbcolname() function in
DBLIB. DBLIB was developed for SQL Server 6.x where the max identifier
length is 30. For this reason, the maximum column length is 30
characters. On platforms where FreeTDS is used (Linux), this is not a
problem.

A note for all who may be struggling...  Microsoft did away with the
ct-lib support in SQL Server 2000, so we can't use that anymore (is
more common to be compiled into php, if mssql is compiled in)

Using MSSQL 2000 and Windows Server 2003 Enterprise running on a
separate machine from the web server, I was unable to get PHP to
connect to MSSQL with default Windows Server 2003 settings.  I got it
working the following way:

From the Windows Server 2003 machine: Control Panel -> Local Security
Settings -> Security Settings -> Local Policies -> Security Options
Set "Network access: Let 'Everyone' permissions apply to anonymous
users" to Enabled


Server (obviously a windows machine of some sort):
--------------------------------------------------

- Create a login *in* the ms sql server which has 'create databases' server
  role and optionally bulk inserts
- Set the default database to 'master' (it probably already is)
- Make sure (with server network utility) that server listens for TCP/IP
  connections and jot down the port on which it does that


Xaraya Implementation Notes
---------------------------
- the connection has to include the port number in the xaraya install (like:
  10.0.0.29:1433)
- Using the 'auto increment' logic. 
  Xaraya used the genID method for generating unique ID's in columns which
  impose the following restrictions:

  1. column must allow an 'explicit value' to be inserted to cater for this
  common construct in Xaraya:
     $nextid = $dbconn->getNextId('xar_table');
     $sql = "insert into xar_table (id, name) values($nextid,'name')";
     $dbconn->Execute($sql)

  2. if column is not specified in the insert statement an id must be
  generated automatically
     $sql = "insert into xar_table(name) values ('name')
     $dbconn->Execute($sql);

  (the latter is the preferred method, if we all used that the following trick
  would not be necessary)
  
  MS SQL has, in theory, an IDENTITY property which will automatically
  generate identifiers when inserting columns. For inserting explicit values
  (null or not) a 'SET IDENTITY_INSERT xar_table ON;' has to be given befor the
  insert and ONLY ONE table can have that at one give time (in your session)
  
   MS SQL has no notion of a SEQUENCE like Postgres has.

  I solved this by issuing exactly that before each INSERT/UPDATE statement
  (not sure if the latter is needed though)
