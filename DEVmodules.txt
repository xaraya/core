Remarks on what changes to modules are needed to make sure they can behave
in the 2.x source tree:

* there is no specific API anymore for xarError* functions. All of core has been
  rewritten to throwing Exceptions where needed. The old functions are still
  there, wrapped around the exceptions or 'no-ops' as applicable. In your module:
  
  Generating an error:
    throw new SomeException($vars, 'String with #(1) like replacements here #(2) and there');

* If your module used *direct* ADO functions and or methods, they will not
  work anymore, the AdoDb middleware was replaced by Creole. If your code used
  the xaraya API, no code changes should be necessary, except in a few less
  common constructs.

* xarModApiFunc had a parameter to suppress exceptions. This parameter has
  been removed and an exception is always raised:
  Example:
      // don't throw an exception if this function doesn't exist (the zero at the end)
      $mytypes = xarModAPIFunc($modname,'user','getitemtypes', array(), 0);
  
  New code:
      try {
        $mytypes = xarModAPIFunc($modname,'user','getitemtypes');
      } catch (Exception $e) {
        $mtypes = array();
      }
      
* if your module depended on $modname/xartemplates/objects/*list* templates,
  they will have to be renamed to $modname/xartemplates/objects/*view* as the
  2 GUI methods for 'list' and 'view' have been consolidated into one.

* if your module creates or uses properties, their naming scheme has changed
  considerably. the 'Dynamic_' prefix was removed from most and some names
  have changed to reflect their contents better. There is no direct need to
  change your filenames, but it is recommended to follow this practice. See
  base/xarproperties for examples.

* functions which were deprecated (i.e. only working when Legacy support was
  set to 'On' will NOT work anymore in 2.x.) The functions have been removed
  completely.

* where 1.x contained 'some' postnuke compatibility, this has been
  completely removed from 2.x.

* if your module used one of the following functions:
    * xarPreCoreGetVarDirPath           - REPLACED by sys::varpath()
    * dynamicdata/adminapi/checkinput   - DROPPED 
    * dynamicdata/userapi/interface     - DROPPED 
    * dynamicdata/userapi/getsource     - DROPPED

  your code will not work anymore, as all of the above function have been
  removed.

* if your module used the $prep parameter in any of the *get*Var functions
  in core, you will have to change your code to add prepping explicitly if you
  need it.
