A log of important changes made to the 2.x branch which we need to
revisit later on before trusting the branch to be released or used.

!!!DB-CHANGES:
* module_uservars is now module_itemvars where item is an item in a
  module, not only roles. The columns are adapted accordingly.
* hooks table now registers the mod id in the columns smodid and
  tmodid instead of the name of the module.
* adminpanels as module is completely gone, which also means its table
  was deleted. The complete functionality of adminpanels is now in the
  modules module.
* template_tags column xar_module replaced by a column xar_modid
* security_instances column xar_module replaced by column xar_modid
* security_masks column xar_module replaced by column xar_modid
* xar_roles column xar_auth_module replaced by column
  xar_auth_modid. The interface WAS NOT ADAPTED but nothing uses the
  auth_module directly and the columns is probably going to move away
  to somewhere else anyway. 
* xar_block_types column xar_module replaced by column xar_modid. This
  was far out the most intrusive one since that table is used in the
  privilege instance queries. I adapted as best as I could, no doubt
  they wont work anymore in some cases. We'll see.
* table theme_states has been dropped, where the xar_state column is
  now in the themes table itself.
* table module_states has been dropped, where the xar_state column is
  now in the modules table itself.
* table config_vars has been dropped, now managed by module_vars where
  modid==0

(see DEVupgrades.sql for the above)

!!!OTHER CHANGES POSSIBLY AFFECTING UPGRADES:
* when encountered, upgrade code to upgrade modules from older
  versions than in 1.0 is removed, assuming we will only support 
  upgrading from 1.0 to 2.x and not versions before 1.0 
* the whole exception subsystem was rewritten from scratch and the
  whole of core was adapted to use it. (see new RFC-0054)
* adodb has been replaced with the creole database abstraction layer.
* the meaning of xar:comment and <!-- has been reversed as observed as
  a design error. xar:comment now produces a comment in the output while things
  between <!-- and --> get ignored by the BL parser. If you're previous xar:comment
  content was sensitive you might wanna reverse it in your templates
  too.
* where applicable all pn compatibility has been removed.
* The distinction between system and site table mapping have been
  removed from core. A fullblown alternative has not yet been
  provided, but we know that just doing system/site mapping is not
  enough
  (that said: the table sharing, which is by far the prominent use can
  be solved very easily by defining views in the backend, we can/should
  certainly consider adapting the installer to create additional sites
  into an existing installation.
* the xar:template tag behaviour has been extended to allow an open
  form. This is a preparation, so the tag can function as the root tag
  for a template. The current behaviour is just to accept the tag, but
  no functional behaviour is attached to it yet. In a way the
  xar:template tag and the xar:blocklayout tag are moving closer to
  eachother.
* DROPPED API: xarMod_getVarsByName, xarTheme_getVarsByName (were
  protected and never used)
* DROPPED API: $throwException parameter in xarModAPIFunc

!!DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PHP 5.0 and 5.1
* do not agree on what function_exists() / is_callable() /
  method_exists() should return
* In PHP 5.0.4 (and earlier versions I believe) the shutdown function is called after the output buffering callback.
* In PHP 5.1.2 (not sure when the change occurred) the shutdown function is called before the output buffering callback.
* apparently PHP 5.1 allows headers to be sent in a shutdown function  (arguably wrong)


!!!REFACTORING LIST:
List of things which need to be refactored before starting the actual
design work can begin.

* i really like some sort of import(name.of.some.sub.part) dot notation to
  include major parts into the flow when doing stuff, instead of
  xarInclude or something
* Finish up the planned db changes to normalizing the database.
* OO-ify stuff in core where appropriate (including getting rid of
  die()'s and modelling the classes where php4 could not) 
* I really would like to do something with views wrt multisites et. al.
* I really would like to do something with triggers, dunno for what
* I really would like to do something with stored procedures, dunno
  for what
* the need for a Request mapper is evident. Apart from the gained
  dimension for navigation design this also centralizes the short url
  functionality instead of distributing it all over. 
* the blocklayout tag could use attributes related to emitting a <?xml
  header or not (or use <?xar for this? since it is an instruction to
  process )
* we keep a 'state' of some sort for different items:
  1. modules
  2. themes
  3. roles
  4. blocks
  5. dd_properties
  Would it make sense to centralise state management of a generic
  'item' level? Also the use of a workflow component in core comes to mind.
* simplify installer/xaradmin.php before rewriting it
* privileges creates objects now where some number like '1098' enters
  the xar_modid field (which was previously xar_module). This will
  cause confusion. (unfinished?, experiment?, ask marc)
* we need easy and global xmlhttp request support everywhere.
* xaraya is an excellent backend, we need a equally excellent front-end companion (like dojo)
* i'd really like more native backend support, for query preparation
  that place is obviously creole, but for shielding and triggering we
  dont have an abstraction and the more complex modules go through a
  whole lot of hoops sometimes which the backend could do in a jiffy.


!!!KNOWN ISSUES
* blocks do not end up in groups anymore during installation, need to
  investigate why that is. Most likely a missed spot when doing the
  schema migration. 
* since we now use the meta info classes, some functions in DD which
  depend on the linkage info from tables to modules (which was
  unreliable) is lost, so expect surprising results in 'meta' areas in
  DD for now until we figure our *if* and *how* we want to link
  components to physical tables.


!!!MIN. REQUIRED VERSIONS DETERMINED SO FAR
* PHP      5.0.5
* Mysql    5.0.18
* Postgres 8.0.6
* Sqlite   N/A (embedded in PHP, i think it's 2.8.x for non PDO and  3.x for PDO)
* Oracle   ?
* MsSql    ? (server 2003?)

!!!Requirements for a front end (js) library
- widget (or controls) is our immediate direct need to lighten the
  burden on template/theme maintenance
- having events on the controls to asynchronously load other data is
  the second need (master detail relations, repopulation combo's etc.)
- specifying the controls should be a 3 step process maximal:
  1. include on js entry point for the request
  2. write the controls inside a xar-template 
  3. (optional) customize the default behaviour to the applications
need.
Whether the tags used are compiled/transformed on the server or
through a js callback is irrelevant for us.
