A log of important changes made to the 2.x branch which we need to
revisit later on before trusting the branch to be released or used.

!!!DB-CHANGES:
* module_uservars is now module_itemvars where item is an item in a
  module, not only roles. The columns are adapted accordingly.
* hooks table now registers the mod id in the columns smodid and
  tmodid instead of the name of the module.
* adminpanels as module is completely gone, which also means its table
  was deleted. The complete functionality of adminpanels is now in the
  modules module.
* template_tags column xar_module replaced by a column xar_modid
* security_instances column xar_module replaced by column xar_modid
* security_masks column xar_module replaced by column xar_modid
* xar_roles column xar_auth_module replaced by column
  xar_auth_modid. The interface WAS NOT ADAPTED but nothing uses the
  auth_module directly and the columns is probably going to move away
  to somewhere else anyway. 
* xar_block_types column xar_module replaced by column xar_modid. This
  was far out the most intrusive one since that table is used in the
  privilege instance queries. I adapted as best as I could, no doubt
  they wont work anymore in some cases. We'll see.
* table theme_states has been dropped, where the xar_state column is
  now in the themes table itself.
* table module_states has been dropped, where the xar_state column is
  now in the modules table itself.
* table config_vars has been dropped, now managed by module_vars where
  modid==0
* table security_levels has been dropped, now managed by SecurityLevel class
* tables privmembers, rolemembers and security_acl have their unique key on
  2 columns replaced by a primary key.

(see DEVupgrades.sql for the above)

!!!OTHER CHANGES POSSIBLY AFFECTING UPGRADES:
* [N/A anymore] when encountered, upgrade code to upgrade modules from older
  versions than in 1.0 is removed, assuming we will only support 
  upgrading from 1.0 to 2.x and not versions before 1.0 
  NOTE: 
    when changing modules to return upgrade_themodule('1.0') instead of
    return true, the original upgrade from init need to be placed in the 
    upgrade routine again. (luckily i replaced this only for one or two)
    modules, which have now been propagate from c.x.c to c.x.c.2.x so DO NOT
    remove old upgrade code anymore now! 
* the whole exception subsystem was rewritten from scratch and the
  whole of core was adapted to use it. (see new RFC-0054)
* adodb has been replaced with the creole database abstraction layer.
* the meaning of xar:comment and <!-- has been reversed as observed as
  a design error. xar:comment now produces a comment in the output while things
  between <!-- and --> get ignored by the BL parser. If you're previous xar:comment
  content was sensitive you might wanna reverse it in your templates
  too.
* where applicable all postnuke compatibility has been removed.
* The distinction between system and site table mapping have been
  removed from core. A fullblown alternative has not yet been
  provided, but we know that just doing system/site mapping is not
  enough
  (that said: the table sharing, which is by far the prominent use can
  be solved very easily by defining views in the backend, we can/should
  certainly consider adapting the installer to create additional sites
  into an existing installation.
* the xar:template tag behaviour has been extended to allow an open
  form. This is a preparation, so the tag can function as the root tag
  for a template. The current behaviour is just to accept the tag, but
  no functional behaviour is attached to it yet. In a way the
  xar:template tag and the xar:blocklayout tag are moving closer to
  eachother.


!!CHANGED API

* $throwException parameter in xarModAPIFunc, the api function will now raise
  an excpeption always. The occurances of these were not found. If there are
  such usages (i.e. calls explicitly suppressing the exception) they can do so
  again by using a try/catch block around the call. (occurances found have
  been adapted)

* the Variable getting/setting in core does NOT support direct prepping 
  anymore, as to eliminate dependencies on other subsystems. If the parameter 
  was used, it will be ignored now. USAGE UNKNOWN.

!!DROPPED API

* xarMod_getVarsByName, xarTheme_getVarsByName : protected API and never used
* xarPreCoreGetVarDirPath (now sys::varpath()) 
* xarModAPIFunc('dynamicdata','admin','checkinput') : never 
* xarModAPIFunc('dynamicdata','user','interface') : never used
* xarModAPIFunc('dynamicdata','user','getsources') : never used


!!DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PHP 5.0/5.1/5.2
* do not agree on what function_exists() / is_callable() /
  method_exists() should return
* In PHP 5.0.4 (and earlier versions I believe) the shutdown function is 
  called *after* the output buffering callback.
* In PHP 5.1.2 (not sure when the change occurred) the shutdown function is 
  called *before* the output buffering callback.
* apparently PHP 5.1 allows headers to be sent in a shutdown function  
  (arguably wrong)

!!!REFACTORING LIST:
List of things which need to be refactored before starting the actual
design work can begin.

* At some point we need to get our act together wrt xar:set, setting variables,
  notably arrays is flaky at best. The munging with PHP code (like the '1;' trick) 
  needs to stop or be reliable
* [DONE] i really like some sort of import(name.of.some.sub.part) dot notation to
  include major parts into the flow when doing stuff, instead of
  xarInclude or something
* Finish up the planned db changes to normalizing the database.
  Open issues:
        - does blocks really need 5 tables?
        - [DONE] dynamic relations table is floating in there for a long time (removed)
        - xar_realm in xar_security masks uses 'All' which prevents it from being
          a foreign key to the realm table (through id), likewise for xar_privileges 
          table
        - [DONE] if we are going to store privilege levels in the database, 
          then refer to them from other tables, we now store the level verbatim 
          (perhaps drop the table?)
        - similarly, in xar_privileges table the xar_module column. 
        - is xar_auth_mod_id still needed? 
            Answer: yes, but it's confusing:
            1. it doesnt need to be there really, but might be a moditemvar (it applies to the few)
            2. it is referred to as default authmodule in the code sometimes, which it is not, it
            is the auth module which successfully logged this user on latest.
        - the xar_ prefix on columns is redundant
* [STARTED] OO-ify stuff in core where appropriate (including getting rid of
  die()'s and modelling the classes where php4 could not) 
* I really would like to do something with views wrt multisites et. al.
    - the query storage for privilege instances is one application of views 
    (in testing, views are *much* slower than dedicated tables, which doesnt 
    make sense to me; i expect them to be _somewhat_ slower, but not a factor 
    of 4-8)
* I really would like to do something with triggers, dunno for what
    - all backends support triggers, while not all of them support foreign
      keys, so for both triggers and foreign keys we could use triggers.
* I really would like to do something with stored procedures, dunno
  for what
    - the main use would be to save round trips (to the db server in this case,
    *not* the webserver) and building more on the server side based on logic, 
    e.g. instead of looping over 1 resultset in php and reacting based on that, 
    that logic could be done directly at the db server, letting the stored 
    procedure do the looping, if at all needed  and only return the combined 
    result to the php code
* the need for a Request mapper is evident. Apart from the gained
  dimension for navigation design this also centralizes the short url
  functionality instead of distributing it all over. The Zend framework Controller
  class (and its friends) comes very close to what we need.
* the blocklayout tag could use attributes related to emitting a <?xml
  header or not (or use <?xar for this? since it is an instruction to
  process )
* design a more solid concept for letting blocklayout emit http headers, attributes
  in the blocklayout tag dont cut it. (disposition is one needed, as well as 
  more granular caches)
* we keep a 'state' of some sort for different items:
  1. modules
  2. themes
  3. roles
  4. blocks
  5. dd_properties
  Would it make sense to centralise state management of a generic
  'item' level? Also the use of a workflow component in core comes to mind.
* simplify installer/xaradmin.php before rewriting it
* we need easy and global xmlhttp request support everywhere.
* Xaraya is an excellent backend, we need a equally excellent front-end 
  companion (like dojo) integrated into core, NOT as a module. But lightweight
  and seemlessly integrated with BL, as an extension tag lib for example. 
  (plextk has something like that)
* i'd really like more native backend support, for query preparation
  that place is obviously creole, but for shielding and triggering we
  dont have an abstraction and the more complex modules go through a
  whole lot of hoops sometimes which the backend could do in a jiffy.
* the installer screens try to throw all databases onto one pile, we need to split 
    the database configuration screens into different ones for each backend
    * sqlite has no user and password (uses os file based privs)
    * sqlite uses a directory for a host (in creole and even that is a patch from us)
    * mysql can support different table drivers (myisam, innodb) transparently
    * postgres may require schema support
* xml constructs like PI, ELEM and ATTR need their equivalent in BL, but the current
  implementation lacks context.
  - [STARTED] element tag
  - attribute tag
  - pi tag? or pi support? (answer: both, they are 2 different things)
* [STARTED] finish design and implementation os schema based data definition 
* design a less bloated concept for config/user/mod/theme/system vars etc
* reorganize the old error/exception system to use much fewer files, consider
  writing a talkback module to go along with a distro for facilitating the bug
  reporting we can build into an install. (bugzilla can be remotely queried for
  products and components easily, perhaps based on a server side map of 
  regid-component for modules at least)
* [STARTED] move code from dd procedural functions to classes where feasible
* integrate Object showView and showList

!!!KNOWN ISSUES
* blocks do not end up in groups anymore during installation, need to
  investigate why that is. Most likely a missed spot when doing the
  schema migration. 
* since we now use the meta info classes, some functions in DD which
  depend on the linkage info from tables to modules (which was
  unreliable) is lost, so expect surprising results in 'meta' areas in
  DD for now until we figure our *if* and *how* we want to link
  components to physical tables.
* datadict is absent in 2.x since that lived in adodb, creole does not have it
  - we are going for schema support (see tests/xml/schemas/ddl/*.*)
* there is no upgrade routine for upgrading 1.x to 2.x
* when we're in exception handling for one exception, it seems that no more
  exceptions are thrown in subsequent code
  Example: 
        - dont define date.timezone in php (will raise exception in 
        xarLogger.php early on)
        - make sure CACHEKEYS file is NOT present (should raise exception in 
        caching/template.php lines 168+)
        The fopen() call in caching/template.php does NOT raise an exception then
* [DONE?] property file names are now based upon $property->name instead of their class name 
  as before, this means that Dynamic_Select_Property becomes included via
  sys::import('modules.base.xarproperties.dropdown') instead of 
  sys::import('modules.base.xarproperties.Dynamic_Select_Property')
  this exposes an issue in how we name the property classes themselves and the name
  stored in the database
* showList method in the DataObjectList class has been removed in favor of showView
  due to it's redundancy in code. The data-list tag will continue to operate as normal
  (for now), but any $modname/xartemplates/objects/*list* templates will need to be 
  renamed *view*
 
!!!MIN. REQUIRED VERSIONS DETERMINED SO FAR
* PHP      5.1.4 (probably 5.1.x even)
* Mysql    5.0.18
* Postgres 8.0.6
* Sqlite   N/A (embedded in PHP, i think it's 2.8.x for non PDO and 3.x for PDO)
           There seems to be a sqlite3 extension floating around for php5
* Oracle   ?
* MsSql    ? (server 2003?)

!!!Requirements for a front end (js) library
- widget (or controls) is our immediate direct need to lighten the
  burden on template/theme maintenance
- having events on the controls to asynchronously load other data is
  the second need (master detail relations, repopulation combo's etc.)
- specifying the controls should be a 3 step process maximal:
  1. include on js entry point for the request
  2. write the controls inside a xar-template 
  3. (optional) customize the default behaviour to the applications need.
Wether the tags used are compiled/transformed on the server or
through a js callback is irrelevant for us.
 
 
Columns affected by modid/regid/modname decision:
 - modules.regid
    - is now not null default 0
    - becomes default null
 - dynamic_objects.object_moduleid (stores regid)
 - dynamic_properties.prop_moduleid (stores regid)
 - dynamic_properties_def.prop_req_modules 
    - stores a semicolon separated list of modulenames (does it ever contain 
    more than one?)
 - hooks.smodid (stores 0 now meaning ?)
 - hooks.tmodid ?
 - module_vars.modid (stores 0 now for config vars)
 - privileges.xar_module (stores 'All', 'empty' besides module name.)
All other tables refer to the primary key of the xar_modules table (id)

Possible new QA checks for 2.x code branch
------------------------------------------
- every class declaration should have an 'extends' clause? (we all derive from Object, (sort of ))
- every method implementation should have 'public' 'protected' or 'private'
  (related: the phpdoc @private etc. never made sense to me in php5 context, what's that about?)
- no 'var $varname' like declarations (easy, produces an error anyways)
- no php4 style constructors, always __construct() if any (hard, since have 2 is valid too, sigh.)
- classes start with Capitals (?) (sys class doesnt now, is that bad?)
- add new deprecation info on wrapped API methods (a lot!)



Naming conventions and stuff:
-----------------------------
Hammered: (as in, at least 2 people agreed to this)
    - order of vars and methods in declaration and implementation: public, protected, private
    - class constants go first in the class
    - constructors are always the first method, regardless of scope.
    - ClassNames are UpperCamelCase ¹
    - InterfaceNames are UpperCamelCase ² 
    - methodNames are lowerCamelCase
    - prevent underscores as much as possible (goes for all)
    - use typehinting as much as possible, prefer interfaces over classes when possible for this
    - filenames are lowercase.php
    - use scope identifiers *always* even if public (for clarity, reflection and phpdoc)
    - phpdoc @access only needed for things which dont have access specifiers in php:
        - functions
        - classes 
 
Remarks:
    ¹ we wil NOT use a xar specific prefix for our classes, but instead gamble on namespace
    support to be added in the future. So, everyone, sign the petition here: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/phpns/
    to increase chances :-). Until then we'll cope with the occassional name conflict and dealt with them as they come.
    If namespace support is NOT going to happen (which is getting more unlikely) we can implement the prefix
    once that is certain or do a runkit (see pecl site) layer which allows to spawn environments in their own 
    threads, which would be awesome to have in general, but is less suited for us mere mortals.
    ² for interfaces it's even more important to think thrice about their names. 
    Serializable, Countable are *good* examples, InterfaceForMyClass is *bad*. But what is _enough_ we dont know yet.
    
List of things to hammer (or not):
    - interface inheritance is unclear to me, so its hard to come up with some rules for that
    - [WONT] group interface satisfaction methods together
