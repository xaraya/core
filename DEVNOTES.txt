A log of important changes made to the 2.x branch which we need to
revisit later on before trusting the branch to be released or used.

!!!DB-CHANGES:
* module_uservars is now module_itemvars where item is an item in a
  module, not only roles. The columns are adapted accordingly.
* hooks table now registers the mod id in the columns smodid and
  tmodid instead of the name of the module.
* adminpanels as module is completely gone, which also means its table
  was deleted. The complete functionality of adminpanels is now in the
  modules module.
* template_tags column xar_module replaced by a column xar_modid
* security_instances column xar_module replaced by column xar_modid
* security_masks column xar_module replaced by column xar_modid
* xar_roles column xar_auth_module replaced by column
  xar_auth_modid. The interface WAS NOT ADAPTED but nothing uses the
  auth_module directly and the columns is probably going to move away
  to somewhere else anyway. 
* xar_block_types column xar_module replaced by column xar_modid. This
  was far out the most intrusive one since that table is used in the
  privilege instance queries. I adapted as best as I could, no doubt
  they wont work anymore in some cases. We'll see.
* table theme_states has been dropped, where the xar_state column is
  now in the themes table itself.
* table module_states has been dropped, where the xar_state column is
  now in the modules table itself.
(see DEVupgrades.sql for the above)

!!!OTHER CHANGES POSSIBLY AFFECTING UPGRADES:
* when encountered, upgrade code to upgrade modules from older
  versions than in 1.0 is removed, assuming we will only support 
  upgrading from 1.0 to 2.x and not versions before 1.0 
* the whole exception subsystem was rewritten from scratch and the
  whole of core was adapted to use it. (see new RFC-0054)
* adodb has been replaced with the creole database abstraction layer.
* the meaning of xar:comment and <!-- has been reversed as observed as
  a design error. xar:comment now produces a comment in the output while things
  between <!-- and --> get ignored by the BL parser. If you're previous xar:comment
  content was sensitive you might wanna reverse it in your templates
  too.
* where applicable all pn compatibility has been removed.

!!!REFACTORING LIST:
List of things which need to be refactored before starting the actual
design work can begin.

* i really like some sort of import(name.of.some.sub.part) dot notation to
  include major parts into the flow when doing stuff, instead of
  xarInclude or something
* Finish up the planned db changes to normalizing the database.
* OO-ify stuff in core where appropriate (including getting rid of
  die()'s and modelling the classes where php4 could not) 
* I really would like to do something with views wrt multisites et. al.
* I really would like to do something with triggers, dunno for what
* I really would like to do something with stored procedures, dunno
  for what
* the need for a Request mapper is evident. Apart from the gained
  dimension for navigation design this also centralizes the short url
  functionality instead of distributing it all over. 
* the blocklayout tag could use attributes related to emitting a <?xml
  header or not (or use <?xar for this? since it is an instruction to
  process )
* we keep a 'state' of some sort for different items:
  1. modules
  2. themes
  3. roles
  4. blocks
  5. dd_properties
  Would it make sense to centralise state management of a generic
  'item' level? Also the use of a workflow component in core comes to mind.
* simplify installer/xaradmin.php before rewriting it
* privileges creates objects now where some number like '1098' enters
  the xar_modid field (which was previously xar_module). This will
  cause confusion. (unfinished?, experiment?, ask marc)
* we need easy and global xmlhttp request support everywhere.
* xaraya is an excellent backend, we need a equally excellent front-end companion (like dojo)

!!!KNOWN ISSUES
* blocks do not end up in groups anymore during installation, need to
  investigate why that is. Most likely a missed spot when doing the
  schema migration. 
* since we now use the meta info classes, some functions in DD which
  depend on the linkage info from tables to modules (which was
  unreliable) is lost, so expect surprising results in 'meta' areas in
  DD for now until we figure our *if* and *how* we want to link
  components to physical tables.


!!!VIEWS support for backends:
- mysql   : yes, since 5.0
- sqlite  : yes, since forever, but read only (which is a good thing,  but a pain when you're migrating )
- postgres: yes, since 7.3 (at least)
- mssql   : yes, no idea version wise
- oracle  : ?

!!!TRANSACTION support for backends:
- mysql   : yes, innodb engine only ( gracefull fallback provided by middleware?)
- sqlite  : yes, since forever
- postgres: yes
- mssql   : yes
- oracle  : ?

!!!FOREIGN KEY support for backends:
- mysql   : yes, innodb engine only
- sqlite  : no
- postgres: yes
- mssql   : yes, no idea version wise
- oracle  : ?

!!!TRIGGER support for backends:
- mysql   : yes, since 5.0.2
- sqlite  : yes, since forever
- postgres: yes, at least since 7.3
- mssql   : yes, at least since mssql server 2000
- oracle  : ?

!!!MIN. REQUIRED VERSIONS DETERMINED SO FAR
* PHP      5.0.5
* Mysql    5.0.18
* Postgres 8.0.6
* Sqlite   N/A (embedded in PHP, i think it's 2.8.x for non PDO and  3.x for PDO)
* Oracle   ?
* MsSql    ? (server 2003?)

!!!Requirements for a front end (js) library
- widget (or controls) is our immediate direct need to lighten the
  burden on template/theme maintenance
- having events on the controls to asynchronously load other data is
  the second need (master detail relations, repopulation combo's etc.)
- specifying the controls should be a 3 step process maximal:
  1. include on js entry point for the request
  2. write the controls inside a xar-template 
  3. (optional) customize the default behaviour to the applications
need.
Whether the tags used are compiled/transformed on the server or
through a js callback is irrelevant for us.
