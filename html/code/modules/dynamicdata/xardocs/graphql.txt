Introduction
============
The library that the GraphQL API relies on [https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php] allows defining the schema
in 2 different basic ways:
1. via code using a Schema() object and type loader where each object type is coded (in-line or as subclass), or
2. via a schema file and a type config decorator where you can then override the default field resolver in code

There are some complementary tools that allow you to create the schema in other ways like annotations, models etc.
but the GraphQL API follows the same concept: you can either use code to define the types and how they should be
handled, or use a schema file as basis for the types and fields and then define how to resolve the fields in code.

In addition, the Xaraya GraphQL API allows you to automatically map dynamic DataObjects into GraphQL types and
handle them with either approach, using their property types to define and include extra ObjectTypes into the
overall schema.

When you select extra objects to include in the DynamicData Test APIs web interface and press "rebuild", this
will generate both a new graphql_objects.json file for inclusion via code, and a new schema.graphql file if
you prefer to use that approach.

In terms of performance, inclusion via code will be faster to generate the schema and execute each API call.
Also it makes sense to use a separate ObjectType class if you want to override how a particular DataObject is
queried and/or its fields are resolved afterwards.
