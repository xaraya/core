phpmailer - PHP email class
==============================
http://phpmailer.sourceforge.net

Please read LICENSE for information on this softwares availability and
distribution.

Class Features:
- Send emails with multiple TOs, CCs, BCCs and REPLY-TOs
- Redundant SMTP servers
- Multipart/alternative emails for mail clients that do not read HTML email
- Support for 8bit, base64, binary, and quoted-printable encoding
- Uses the same methods as the very popular AspEmail active server (COM) component
- SMTP authentication
- Word wrap
- Many more...

Why you might need it:

Many PHP developers utilize email in their code.  The only PHP function
that supports this is the mail() function.  However, it does not expose
any of the popular features that many email clients use nowadays like
HTML-based emails and attachments. There are two proprietary
development tools out there that have all the functionality built into
easy to use classes: AspEmail(tm) and AspMail.  Both of these
programs are COM components only available on Windows.  They are also a
little pricey for smaller projects.

Since I do Linux development I’ve missed these tools for my PHP coding.
So I built a version myself that implements the same methods (object
calls) that the Windows-based components do. It is open source and the
LGPL license allows you to place the class in your proprietary PHP
projects.


Installation:

Copy class.phpmailer.php into your php.ini include_path. If you are
using the SMTP mailer then place class.smtp.php in your path as well.

Example

<?php
require("class.phpmailer.php");

$mail = new phpmailer();

$mail->IsSMTP();                                      // set mailer to use SMTP
$mail->Host = "smtp1.site.com;smtp2.site.com";        // specify main and backup server
$mail->SMTPAuth = true     // turn on SMTP authentication
$mail->Username = "jswan"  // SMTP username
$mail->Password = "secret" // SMTP password

$mail->From = "from@email.com";
$mail->FromName = "Mailer";
$mail->AddAddress("josh@site.com", "Josh Adams");
$mail->AddAddress("ellen@site.com");                  // name is optional
$mail->AddReplyTo("info@site.com", "Information");

$mail->WordWrap = 50;                                 // set word wrap to 50 characters
$mail->AddAttachment("/var/tmp/file.tar.gz");         // add attachments
$mail->AddAttachment("/tmp/image.jpg", "new.jpg");    // optional name
$mail->IsHTML(true);                                  // set email format to HTML

$mail->Subject = "Here is the subject";
$mail->Body    = "This is the HTML message body <b>in bold!</b>";
$mail->AltBody = "This is the body in plain text for non-HTML mail clients";

if(!$mail->Send())
{
   echo "Message could not be sent. <br/><br/>";
   echo "Mailer Error: " . $mail->ErrorInfo;
   exit;
}

echo "Message has been sent";
?>
