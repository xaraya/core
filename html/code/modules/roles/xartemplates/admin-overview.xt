            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>
                The Roles module lets you create and manage roles on your Xaraya site. Roles are
                representations of the site's registered users and the different groups they can belong to. The Roles module is a core module within Xaraya and cannot be removed. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Detail information on this module can be found <a href="#xarModURL('modules','admin','modinfo',array('id' => xarMod::getRegid('roles')))#">here</a>.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Concepts</h3>
            <h4>Roles</h4>
            <p>
                Roles represent <em>users</em> and <em>groups of users</em> in Xaraya. Roles can be members of other roles, to any degree. You can, for instance, use roles to represent a company's organization chart, or class enrolements at a university.
            </p>
            <p>
                By assigning privileges to roles, you define what a given role may or may not do on the site. Moreover, roles inherit the privileges of their ancestors, so in assigning a role to a specific group, it automatically has the privileges common to the group. The inherited privileges can be supplemented or constrained by assigning further privileges directly to the role. 
            </p>
            <h4>Default Roles in Xaraya</h4>
            <p>
                The roles on your site are arranged in a tree, at the top of which is a role called Everybody, which represents the "group of all groups" on your site. Every user and every group is a member or descendent of Everybody. The structure of the default roles that are installed with Xaraya is shown below:
            </p>
            <pre>
            Everybody (group)
            |
            |---Anonymous (user)
            |
            |---Administrators (group)
            |   |
            |   |---Admin (user)
            |
            |---SiteManagers (group)
            |   |
            |   |---SiteManager (user)
            |
            |---Users (group)
            </pre>
            <p>
                At installation time you are asked to choose a configuration that affects preinstalled
                privileges assigned to the default roles. The privileges can be changed after installation.
                The default roles and minimum privileges at installation time are.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Everybody:</strong>&#160;the role containing all other roles. The access privileges are defined by the configuration chosen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Anonymous:</strong>&#160;a user that represents the unregistered users on your site. The access privileges are defined by the configuration chosen. This role can be initially configured with privileges only to access the front page of the site and the login block.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Administrators:</strong>&#160;a group that has administration privileges. By default it has complete access to the site.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Admin:</strong>&#160;a member of Administrators. This is the Admin role you create with the Xaraya installer. It inherits the privileges of its parent group.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>SiteManagers:</strong>&#160;a group that has DELETE privileges. The members of this group can modify, add and delete data throughout the site, but are barred from changing the configuration settings of modules.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>SiteManager:</strong>&#160;a member of SiteManagers. This is the default SiteManager role you create with the Xaraya installer. It inherits the privileges of its parent group.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Users:</strong>&#160;a group that normally holds registered users of the site. N.B.: this role does not come preconfigured with any privileges. <em>Its members will not have access to the site until you assign some privileges.</em>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To reduce the risk of inadvertent damage Xaraya places constraints on how preconfigured roles can be changed or removed. However, you can define as many more roles in the tree as you wish in whatever configuration you choose.
            </p>
            <h4>Designated Site Administrator</h4>
            <p>
                The designated site admin is a role that is distinguished among others. Xaraya keepts track fo this role's ID, and its value can be retrieved at any time through a special module variable:
                <pre>
                    xarModVars::get('roles', 'admin')
                </pre>
                The designated site admin is used in several places in Xaraya for privileged access. It can be thought of as the "root" user of a Xaraya site and is by convention a member of the Administrator's group (although Xaraya places no restriction on which user can be the designated site admin.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Admin interface</h3>
            <p>
                As an administrator, you can change the module's configuration by pointing your browser to the configuration page <strong>Admin Menu &#8594; Roles &#8594; Modify Configuration</strong>. The configuration page includes the standard display options common to all core modules (see the Base module overview for an explanation of these).
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, this module also supports the following configuration options:

                        <strong>Designated site administrator:</strong>&#160;defines a "root" administrator for the site who is guaranteed to have unrestricted access at all times. The designated site admin is by definition a member of the Administrators group.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Default group for new users:</strong>&#160;When creating new users on the site they will automatically be made members of this group, unless specifically overridden.
