/**
 * Main FEATURES of this class:
 * - conversion between 1 byte charsets
 * - conversion from 1 byte to multi byte charset (utf-8)
 * - conversion from multibyte charset (utf-8) to 1 byte charset
 * - every conversion output can be save with numeric entities
 *   (browser charset independent - not a full truth)
 *
 * Convert Tables Directory
 * 
 * This is a place where you store all files with charset encodings.
 * Filenames should have the same names as encodings.
 * My advise is to keep existing names, because they were taken
 * from unicode.org (www.unicode.org), and after update to unicode 3.0 or 4.0
 * the names of files will be the same.
 * 
 * This is a list of charsets you can operate with, the basic rule is
 * that a char have to be in both charsets, otherwise you'll get an error.

 *
 * The file with encoding tables have to be save in "Format A"
 * of unicode.org charset table format!
 * This is usualy writen in a header of every charset file.
 *
 * The files with encoding tables have to be complete
 * (Non of chars can be missing, unless you are sure
 * you are not going to use it)
 * 
 * "Format A" encoding file, if you have to build it by yourself
 * should aplly these rules:
 * - you can comment everything with #
 * - first column contains 1 byte chars in hex starting from 0x..
 * - second column contains unicode equivalent in hex starting from 0x....
 * - then every next column is optional, but in "Format A"
 *   it should contain unicode char name or/and your own comment
 * - the columns can be splited by "spaces", "tabs", "," or
 *   any combination of these
 * - below is an example
 * 
 * <code>
 * #
 * #    The entries are in ANSI X3.4 order.
 * #
 * 0x00    0x0000    #    NULL end extra comment, if needed
 * 0x01    0x0001    #    START OF HEADING
 * # Oh, one more thing, you can make comments inside of a rows if you like.
 * 0x02    0x0002    #    START OF TEXT
 * 0x03    0x0003    #    END OF TEXT
 * next line, and so on...
 * </code>
 * 
 * You can get full tables with encodings from http://www.unicode.org
