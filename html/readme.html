                                    This page is here to guide you through the steps of configuring the Xaraya web applications framework for a NEW installation. If you are upgrading an EXISTING Xaraya 2.0.0 (or later) installation to Xaraya 2.3.0, please point your browser to upgrade.php and run the upgrade script.
                                </p>

                                    For more support resources click on the first link in the header above. Once you have completed the simple steps outlined below, you should run the installer script by pointing your web browser at http://www.mydomain.com/install.php.

                                <p class="center">
                                    Xaraya is an Open Source web applications framework. It provides a stable and secure core, with a function rich API and powerful templating engine in place for third-party
                                    developers. Xaraya 2.3.0 is a major rewrite that offers enhanced performance with a smaller foorprint, more versatile functionality, easier usability and strict adherence to XHTML standards.

                                    Xaraya consists of three main components, each in its own folder:

                                        <li>
                                            <b>lib</b> folder: contains Xaraya and third party libraries. These include the Xaraya core code, the Blocklayout templating engine, and the Creole database middleware.

                                    The top level of your installation (the xaraya-2.3.0 folder) is called the <em>root directory</em>. For special situations the root directory can be redefined to as different directory on your server (see Custom Installations below).

                                    Xaraya lets you move the html, lib and code folders to different locations on your server. By moving the last two When creating such a custom layout you need to adjust the values in the var/layout.system.php appropriately. The following rules apply:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            The value of $systemConfiguration['rootDir'] is the location of the root directory as an absolute location or relative to the file index.php. The root directory is notional and serves only as a reference point for the Xaraya components. It does not need to have any specific name or even be associated with Xaraya. Examples on a Linux server:
                                            <pre>
    $systemConfiguration['rootDir'] = '/usr/local/';    absolute location on the server
    $systemConfiguration['rootDir'] = '../';            location relative to index.php
                                            </pre>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            The values of $systemConfiguration['webDir'], $systemConfiguration['libDir'] and $systemConfiguration['codeDir'] must correspond to the locations of the html, lib and code directories respectively <b>relative to the root directory</b>.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

In many shared hosting environments the document root directory has a different name, such as 'public_html'. To change the name of the Xaraya document root:

                                    Note that in the "flat install" configuration in var/layout.system.php, the document root directory is given as "". In such cases where the directory is not explicitly named, no changes to the layout file need to be made.

                                    Xaraya easily lets you run multiple sites sharing the resources in the code and lib directories. If you have created a single instance installation on a server as described above, you can add another instance by doing the following:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Make a copy of the html folder and its contents and place it in a location accessible by the webserver, renaming it if required to avoid name conflicts with existing folders (the name of is not important).
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            In the new copy of the html folder, make a copy of the file var/config.system.php.dist, place it in the var folder and name it config.system.php. Be sure this file is writable by the web server. If you already have a config.system.php file there from your previous instance, replace it with the new copy.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            In the var/layout.system.php file of your new instance, adjust the relative paths  to the root directory, as well as to the lib, code and html (did you give this a new name?) folders, as described in the Custom Installations chapter above.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Point your web browser to the file install.php of the new instance and run the installer. Your new instance will run off a different database but share the same module and library code.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    -->
                                    To be added
                                </p>

                                            Unless you know what you're doing, never separate the contents of the lib, core or html folders
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Make sure the appropriate files in the var directory are writable by the web server. The installer will complain if it finds that is not the case. If you are translating, be sure that your locales (files and subdirectories under var/locales) are writable.
                                        </li>
