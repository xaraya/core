XARAYA CSS SUBSYSTEM (corecss scenario)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an informal style doc, written to inform both users and developers about
the progress and on-going changes. The doc is FYI only. It should not be used as 
a basis for user and/or developer documentation. Any part of this doc is subject
to changes in the future.

GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THIS SUBPROJECT:

    - Develop CSS subsystem, which would enable the following features:
        
        - easily add css support for a module, theme or any other component
        - support all known methods of css linking and embedding
        - support valid xhtml methods of inclusion of css in theme templates
        - support minimal css administration options
        - support dynamic method of serving css
        - support for strict css file checking and verification
        - support for css oriented error reporting
        - provisional support for doctype agnostic css (xhtml provided already)
        - provisional support for dynamic generation of css files
        - provisional support for parsing css from files
        - provisional support for online css editing
        - provisional support for storing css data in db backend
        - complete encapsulation and abstraction of required css objects
        
    - Develop new concept of Core CSS to allow:
        
        - eliminate inline styling of templates
        - delivery of uniform and universal css rules across modules and themes
        - streamlining of frequently used css patterns and classes
        - interception of cross-browser's rendering problems and bugs
        - ease of common css rulesets management via gui

// CSS CLASS LIB - USER

(users will probably not want to know fine details)

General Purpose: comprehensive support for all CSS aspects of Xaraya
Location: modules/themes/xarclass/
Files: variable number of files with .class.php suffix + this docfile

// CSS CLASS LIB - DEVELOPER

1.  3 singleton objects created at init phase for core, module and theme

1a. Each object is available throughout and can be accessed via helpers.

1b. Current implementation stores objects in global array, but it may change
    even before this document is published. Final version may use objects
    stored in static vars.

2.  Each component is encapsulated in individual subclass of the base class

2a. The base class contains complete set of accessors for all css attributes

2b. The components subclasses contain only relevant functions and class vars
    to deal with the component-oriented tasks.

2c. The subclasses are polymorphic extensions of the base class

2d. The base class need not be instantiated and currently has no associated
    object and is never referenced from anywhere directly.

3.  Current class hierarchy is as follows:
    
    xarCSS (base) <- -> moduleCSS <- -> themeCSS
    xarCSS (base) <- -> moduleCSS <- -> coreCSS

4.  Two extra class collections encapsulate ancillary functions:

    xarCSSPath <- -> cssComponentPath <- -> cssFileInspector
    
    and
    
    htmlCSSTag <- -> linkCSSTag <-> importCSSTag <-> styleCSSTag
    
    Strictly speaking these classes are not required, but useful and compact.
    They also have no class variables and require no creation of objects, 
    so they can be (and are) used with direct access from main classes.

4a. Should more universal helper classes exist elsewhere in xaraya core, 
    then the extra classes can easily be detatched and deprecated in
    favour of the more centralised facilities.

4b. The extra functions only cover (X)HTML language oriented methods out of 
    the box, but can easily be extended or overriden at the runtime if we 
    need doctype agnostic (sensitive) solution in the future.

4c. Whole lib has very small dependency on core. Only 2-3 functions depend on 
    core vars and values and those are part of the extra classes, not main ones.

4d. Description of dependency (chart or runtime diagram) can be made on request.

3+4 A UML diagram can be made on request or upon completion of the subproject.

5.  Inline comments are complete. DocBook style comments are TODO.

5a. Whole lib is coded in php4 style but is also debugged in php5 with xaraya

6.  In plans/development: css parser class and css adminapi class

6a. Class names and descriptions are to follow. 

// THEMES MODULE - USER

in co-operation and with help of css class lib, themes module creates a number
of custom xaraya tags, which can be used freely by all modules and themes to
deal with the css tasks at hand:

<link-module-stylesheet />
<import-module-stylesheet />
<embed-module-styles />

<link-theme-stylesheet />
<import-theme-stylesheet />
<embed-theme-styles />

<additional-styles />

The last one can be used INSTEAD of old #$tpl:additionalStyles# in themes.

Number of parameters is variable for each tag and none for the last one.

Additional tags can be created easily if required and modules may utilise 
the css class lib to create and configure css tags for individual needs.

Examples have been included in xaraya_classic themes and in some core modules.

Note: you may need to run upgrade.php for tags to start working

// THEMES MODULE - DEVELOPER

New module functions:
(TODO: many - need to make a list and describe at a later time)

Changes to old functions: none
Removed module functions: none
Deprecated functions: none

// CORE CHANGES - USER

(no changes from user perspective)

1.  core function xarTplAddStyleLink has been enhanced to include extra
configurable at runtime parameter - media, which is required by all xhtml
linking methods of css

1a. all parameters are now optional

$modname        = null, 
$filename       = null, 
$fileext        = null, 
$themefolder    = null, 
$media          = null

1b. defaults are determined by css class lib, but typically are as follows:

$modname        : current module name
$filename       : same as module name 
$fileext        = css
$themefolder    = empty 
$media          = all

so that calling it from say 'mymodule' module template would result in
a link in any css-aware theme (unless overridden in theme of course):

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all" href="http://localhost/xaraya/modules/mymodule/xarstyles/mymodule.css"/>

// CORE CHANGES - DEVELOPER

New core functions to date:

Provisionally adden a small core css init function to enable including the
class lib and instantiate subclasses. It is located in xarTemplate.php but 
can be easily moved elswhere within core or replaced completely. It needs
no parameters and returns no important data.

Removed core functions: none
Deprecated: none

NOTE - xarTplAddStyleLink may be a good candidate for deprecation, due to 
its limited usefulness (only allows to link external css, no other methods)
