    <h4>About the Xaraya Classic theme</h4>
    <p>This theme is called Xaraya_Classic and comes installed by default with every Xaraya
    distribution package. It is 100% table-free, totally CSS driven and provides a pleasant way to
    explore Xaraya. It also uses examples with commented source demonstrating Xaraya's templating
    power and flexibility.</p>
    <p>We advise you to keep this theme unmodified in your Xaraya theme directory where it will be
    used for future upgrades of your Xaraya site.</p>
