Functionality description
-------------------------

This directory contains files which aim to implement a schema based piece of
functionality which does the following:

1. Define a DTD for describing database schema's (schema.xml) with sufficient
information to describe a certain state to allow for creating the schema as
well as updating an existing schema to reflect that state. [xarddl.dtd]

2. A xml2ddl utility (or API) which takes a schema.xml and produces valid DDL
statements for supported database to create the schema in that database

-> xsltproc xml2ddl-dbvendor.xsl schema.xml > dbvendor.ddl

3. A db2xml utility (or API) which takes a database schema and creates a valid
XML schema file which reflects the same information contained in that database
schema.

-> xar + bl db2xml.xd -> schema.xml

4. A utility which takes an existing database schema plus a schema.xml and
determines valid ddl to update the existing database schema to the one
described in the schema.xml

-> db2xml [dbspec] > dbschema.xml
-> xmldiff2ddl schema.xml dbschema.xml > diffschema.ddl


Analysis
--------

The critical part in code of the above is determining the differences between
an existing (empty) schema in the db and generating the correct ddl statement
to upgrade that existing schema to the reference schema.xml. The type of
situations which may occur are potentially complex, similar to a revision
control system. We do not need the full plethora of options, but should
provide an escape clause, so the user/developer can react on 'impossible'
situations.


Testdata
--------
To be able to develop this, we need testdata:

1. baseschema.xml     - the base schema which is used to create an initial db.
2. targetschema.xml   - contains all sorts of updates to base schema to test
                        those updates. This targetschema should run from any
                        state the current db is in. (including empty)
3a. empty.xml         - special case (no db schema yet) to use as a
                        baseschema.xml
3b. others....        - created along the way.

4   core1xschema.xml  - schema representation of core.1.x
    core2xschema.xml  - schema representation of core.2.x
                        The goal is obviously to create a db having
                        core1xschema.xml as input and then use the created
                        solution to upgrade it to a core2x schema using
                        nothing but the xml file.


Design notes
------------

* Creating a new schema could be viewed upon as an upgrade operation on an
  empty schema, thus making the two operations equivalent

* the dtd design needs a good review, any mistake there will severely limit
  the options further on in the process.

* the xml should not contain any explicit information for updates. (like
  oldname="whatever") if something has been renamed. The system should be
  smart enough to figure that out itself.


Wishes
------
* [DONE] the 'type' attribute for the 'column' element should only
  designate an 'abstract' type, not related  to the database types like
  TINYINT or something.
  The storage types used by different databases can be figured out by the
  generator in combination with other information supplied in the xml.
  This is basically what creole does, but the mapping they use is a set of
  types (JDBC types actually) which are still close to the actual type of
  the database. Since this code is in place, we might as well use it.

    Example set of more abstract types:
        char | binary | number | boolean | date | time

  Ideally these would be children of the 'column' element so the attributes
  can be defined on them specifically (e.g. 'precision' which only makes
  sense for numbers and perhaps time)
* [DONE] scale attribute is confusing, i'd rather use 'precision' or
  'decimals' (also see previous point)
* think about constraints, both on column and table level, they fit in
  nicely as children of the 'column' or 'table' elements.
* [DONE] the mixed case use of 'autoIncrement' is not needed, lead
  to confusion only
* [DONE] the elements 'index' and 'unique' are the same,
  indextype='unique' would  be better imo. Similarly, unique-column and
  index-column are then redundant, either to be replaced by just a
  'index-column' element, or <column name="colname"/> to reference
  a column in the table definition.
* [DONE] an element 'primary' as a grouper around the 'column' element
  would be nice
    Example:
          <table name="test">
              <column name="normal" type="INTEGER" size="4"/>
              <primary>
                  <column name="ref_name" type="INTEGER" size="10"/>
                  <column name="ref1_name" type="INTEGER" size="10"/>
              </primary>
          </table>
* [IRRELEVANT] Primary keys are either automatically indexed, or should
  always be indexed, the generator can take this into account. Some
  databases may do this automatically, either explicit or implicit.
* [DONE] an 'id' attribute on all tags supported.
* vendor parameters *are* useful, add them back at some point, but only if
  we implement right away the support of those parameters (i.e. not only do
  the familiar mysql table type stuff, but also other parameters)
* xaraya doesnt use foreign keys yet, doesnt mean we cant have support in
  the schema for it though.
    Example of how this could look:
        <table name="test">
            <column name="normal" type="INTEGER" size="4"/>
            <primary>
                <column name="ref_name" type="INTEGER" size="10"/>
                <column name="ref1_name" type="INTEGER" size="10"/>
            </primary>
            <foreign remote="other_table"
                ondelete="(cascade|restrict|setnull|none)"
                onupdate="(cascade|restrict|setnull|none)">
                <reference local="ref_name" remote="other_columns_name"/>
            </foreign>
        </table>
  ondelete means:
    what happens to the local record if the remote record gets deleted.
  onupdate means:
    what happens to the local columns if the remote columns get updated.
  If a foreign key is composite, add more <reference/> elements.
* other than the precise size="14" it could be comfortable to specify
 'qualitative' sizes.
    For example:
        small      64K  'c64'       'amoebe'
        medium      1M  'pda'       'fly'
        large      16M  'notebook'  'dog'
        long      256M  'laptop'    'ape'
        huge        4G  'desktop'   'human'
  where the generator translates this into something for the backend that
  fits. The second column would be comfortable from a developer perspective
  without having to know what column type it actually translates into, it
  guarantees to be capable of storing the specified size (at minimum)
* [DONE] I dont like the capital attribute values for 'type'

Initial xarddl.dtd was based on:
    Propel XML database schema DTD
    $Id: database.dtd,v 1.7 2005/03/30 11:38:18 hlellelid Exp $
Changelog in applied order (meaning, if you make a change, add to the bottom):

* removed attribute 'primaryKey' from 'column' element
* removed element 'index-column', replaced it with 'column' to sync it up with
  'primary' definition
* rename element 'database' to 'schema' as that is more accurate

* changed autoIncrement to autoincrement (all lower case)
* made 'name' attributes of type CDATA
* change 'name' attribute of 'table' element to ID
* made 'primary' a required sub of 'table', as a consequence, 'table' itself

June 2007 DECISION: we break compatibility with the original DTDs
